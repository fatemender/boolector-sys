# boolector-sys

This Rust crate provides low-level bindings for the [Boolector] SMT solver,
version 3.2.1.

[Boolector]: https://boolector.github.io/

## Installation

### Using shared `boolector` library

Compile `boolector` as a shared library and install it.  Then add this crate
to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
boolector-sys = "0.6"
```

### Using vendored static `boolector` library

This is possible on UNIX-like targets only.  Add this crate to your `Cargo.toml`
with the `vendor-lgl` feature enabled:

```toml
[dependencies]
boolector-sys = { version = "0.6", features = ["vendor-lgl"] }
```

Enabling `vendor-lgl` will automatically build a static `boolector` library and
link against it.  Currently this uses the Lingeling SAT solver.

In order for the build to succeed, you'll need to install some tools on your
build host; for a Debian-based distribution `build-essential`, `cmake`, and `curl`
should be sufficient.
